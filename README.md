## Deployment
   ### Version Control 

   The version control was maintained using git within GitPod VS Code workspace and push code to main repository.
   - From the VS Code terminal type "git add .", to make changes/updates to the files.
   - Type "git commit -m (insert a short message)", which commits the changes and updates the files.
   - Use "git push" command to push the commited changes to the main repository.

   ### Page Deployment

   The app was deployed to Heroku CLI. The steps are as follows:
   - After creating an account and signing in, click "New" to create a new app from the dashboard.
   - Create a unique name for the app and select region; press "Create app".
   - Go to "Settings" to navigate to "Config Vars."
   - Add Config Vars.
        - For this app was used: "KEY = PORT : VALUE = 8000". As stated in the README.md template for this project. 
   - Add buildpacks Python and NodeJS.
   - Click "Deploy Branch".
   - Scroll down to Deployment Method and select GitHub.
